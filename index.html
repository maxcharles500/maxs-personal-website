                 <h3>HTML</h3>
                 <p>First I will use HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) to create the basic markup, and layout of your website. This is where all of the content displayed on your website will go.</p>

             <div class="box">
                <img src="./images/csslogo.png">
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>After I've written the basic HTML I will move onto CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). CSS is where I will style your website. This is where your input is crucial, because this is really where your website begins to <em>look</em> like a website. This involves anything from changing the font and size of the text, to changing the layout of how your page is displayed. For example if I had not added any CSS styling to this website it would simply be a black and white document with black text and bulleted lists.</p>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Lastly I will make your website interactive and functional by manipulating the DOM(Document Object Model) using Javascript.</p>
